                        <h3 class="mb-4 mb-md-5">Youths are facing more challenges than ever before</h3>
                        <p>In July 2021, a 16-year-old student was charged with the murder of a fellow 13-year-old schoolmate on campus. Following this tragic incident, the mental health of adolescents here quickly became a focus of public interest. With a little bit of digging however, one can see that this issue has been a matter of growing concern in recent times.</p>
                        <p>According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/adolescent-mental-health" target="_blank">World Health Organisation (WHO)</a>, 1 in 7 adolescent aged 10 to 19 year old experiences a mental disorder, yet this issue remains mostly unrecognized and untreated. In the context of Singapore, from 2015 to 2020, the number of youths seen at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for depression rose by about 60 per cent.</p>
                        <h3 class="my-4 my-md-5">Why is this an issue worth addressing?</h3>
                        <p>If left unaddressed, <a href="https://www.who.int/activities/improving-the-mental-and-brain-health-of-children-and-adolescents" target="_blank">adolescent mental health conditions can stretch into adulthood</a>, leading to adverse health, academic and social outcomes that impairs their ability to lead fulfilling lives as adults.
                        <p>When considering these statistics and the potential repercussions, what can we as a society do to make things better?</p>

                            All schools currently have at least one school-counsellor, along with public education programs that help promote mental health literacy.

                            From the survey results, it seems that although youths in Singapore do generally experience distress, many remain reluctant to approach others for help.

                        <p>To summarise thus far, youths may not know where to seek help from and as a result, some may even try to self-diagnose their condition which may result in them seeking the wrong kind of help.</p>
                        <p>There is also reluctance to seek help over fear of being stigmatised by peers and the high cost of treatment. With that, I arrived at the following problem statements:</p>

                            While developing the persona's, the idea of peer support really stuck out to me. From the research, most youths preferred to seek advice from friends. This is no surprise as they may feel more comfortable opening up to those who are of similar age as them.

                            After some brainstorming, I decided that the app would need to have two core components as part of the overall solution:

                    Knowing which right tool to use for a situation is more important than going through a rigid checklist of steps in the design process. There are times when I blindly followed a design process, going through the motions of checking off boxes in a list without really understanding why I'm doing what I'm doing until I took a step back to look at the bigger picture. Design principles shouldn't be linear.
