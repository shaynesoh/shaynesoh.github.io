                        <h3 class="mb-4 mb-md-5">Food waste is a prevalent problem here in Singapore and it is getting worse</h3>
                        <p>The amount of food waste generated has risen by about 20% over the last decade. In 2019 alone, <a href="https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/foodwaste/" target="_blank">Singapore wasted 744 million kg of food</a>, which is equivalent to around 50,000 double decker buses.</p>
                        <p>
                            In fact, households contribute around 50% of the food waste generated in Singapore. According to <a href="https://sec.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SINGAPORE-ENVIRONMENT-COUNCIL-UNVEILS-KEY-INSIGHTS-FROM-STUDY-ON-FOOD-LOSS-AND-FOOD-WASTE-IN-SINGAPORE.pdf" target="_blank">a study</a>, the average household in Singapore throws away over 5 kg of food each week, of which, more than half of the amount can be prevented.

                        <p>I analysed 3 relevant apps that help users to manage their kitchen inventory and reduce food waste.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            I revised the current linear food journey map into a circular one. Here, food items can only be:
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Introduced into the kitchen if users do not already have them,</b></li>
                                <li><b>Removed from the kitchen only via consumption or being used for cooking.</b></li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>By now, I had a pretty clear vision for what I wanted the app to achieve and have in terms of features. I based my storyboard off the potential features, before showing it to my users to validate my design idea.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="mt-4 mt-md-5">

                    <div>
                        <p>The storyboard received an overwhelmingly positive feedback. So I went along with the idea by introducing an appropiate app map.</p>
                        <p>I had to make sure the Foodee app does not repeat the flaws of the apps that were highlighted in the competitive analysis from before.</p>
                        <p>So I kept it as <b>simple and intuitive</b> as possible by revolving it around the users' main touchpoints of food management (kitchen), cooking (recipes), and grocery shopping (shopping list), along with a home tab.</p>

                        Working on a UX project by myself is more difficult than I initially thought, given that UX is a team sport, and that UX activities are usually collaborative in nature. However, the key to overcoming this setback is to follow and employ user-centered design methods, because establishing a user-centered foundation is critical for any project. What's important is to continuously work on generating user research and ensure that I don’t just create gorgeous deliverables that nobody wants to use.
